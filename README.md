1. CRUD Operations on Sales Dataset (curd.ipynb)
Perform CRUD operations on a sales dataset stored in a CSV file. You can choose any Python 
library or tool for database operations or perform them directly on the CSV file. Implement 
the following operations: 
Create: Insert new records into the dataset. 
Read: Retrieve and display specific records from the dataset. 
Update: Modify existing records in the dataset. 
Delete: Remove specific records from the dataset. 
Provide a Python script demonstrating each CRUD operation with relevant comments and 
explanations.

2. Descriptive and Predictive Analysis with Interactive Dashboard (visualization.ipynb)
Take any sales dataset of your choice and perform both descriptive and predictive analysis. 
Create an interactive dashboard using Python visualization libraries such as Plotly or Dash. 
Ensure that the graphs are interactive and can cross-filter each other. Include at least three 
different types of visualizations. 

4. Web Scraping for Product Details (webscrapping.ipynb)
Perform web scraping from two e-commerce websites (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Chroma, 
Reliance Digital). Create a dynamic Python script that allows the user to search for products 
and save the details (e.g., name, price, ratings) in an Excel file. Ensure the code is robust and 
handles dynamic search queries.
